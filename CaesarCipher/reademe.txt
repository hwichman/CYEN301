Instructions for CaesarCipher.py

Command Line: "python CaesarCipher.py <key>"
Where key is an integer from 1-25 that tells the program how far the letters are shifted.

Can input the encoded text directly or through a file and the program should spit it out decoded.

Modifying for a custom alphabet shouldn't be hard. I think all that needs to be done is replacing the alphabet at the top of the program.

May need to modify to work with negative integers if they get evil.
