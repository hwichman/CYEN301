This program extracts a covert message from the delays in between characters of a message transmitted
by a chat server.

example usage(THIS ONLY WORKS ON LINUX):

> python ChatCovertChannelclient.py
Some sort of overt message is being transmitted here. But there is a
hidden message being covertly transmitted! Can you guess it?

Covert message: Gourd is 31337! Of course, we already knew this...
